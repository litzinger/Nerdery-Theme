## Why

This is a simple theme to remove all the pink from the control panel, reduce the rounded corners, and clean up some general alignment/padding/margin issues. It is not intended to be a huge overhaul of the control panel, but instead a redux. It will be kept light and very much in the spirit of the default theme.

### Installation

1. Download the repository and match its directory structure in your EE installation. It should be installed into /themes/cp_themes/nerdery/
2. Place $config['cp_theme'] = 'nerdery'; into your config.php file to ensure all users receive this theme.

Please note that I do not own the name "Nerdery", I simply worked at http://nerdery.com. I created this to be used on all of our EE projects and couldn't think of a better name at the time.
